        <h3>Our Story</h3> 
        <p>Their story began after a fateful swipe right on the dating app Tinder.  I know what you're thinking, who woulda thought? But right from the beginning both could tell that this was a different type of relationship than they have had in the past. Within months of meeting each other they were practically inseparble and were both committed for a lifetime together. Fast forward to today, they have moved from Chicago to Austin with their dog Cooper and are having a wedding on April 21st.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting our site and we are very excited to celebrate with you in Austin this spring!!</p>

        <h4> Keep checking back for further details on the wedding </h4>
